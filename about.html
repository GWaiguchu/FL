        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I’m Fredrick Lala, a wildlife biologist working in Tsavo National Park, one of Africa’s most iconic ecosystems.
           With a background in Wildlife Management, my work focuses on the intersection of human infrastructure and wildlife behavior,
           ensuring a sustainable future for both.</p>
        <h3>Biography</h3>
        <p>Born and raised in Nakuru, Kenya, I developed a passion for wildlife conservation at an early age.
           Over the years, my research has explored the impact of infrastructure on species like lions, elephants, and
           Critically Endangered Hirola. I also have a keen interest in studying wildlife bones, which provide valuable insights into ecosystem health.</p>
